<p>In this challenge, you will apply the collection, transformation, and analysis techniques we've explored to <b>hunt down an intrusion</b> using a <b>post-compromise dataset</b>. Your role is to step into the identification and containment phase of incident response by confirming that an intrusion has occurred, identifying indicators to  scope out the intrusion across the enterprise, and preparing the groundwork for containment and remediation.</p>

<p>The dataset provided comes from <i>Avongate Industries</i>, where a number of <b>Kansa collection modules</b> were used to collect artifacts from a subset of the enterprise. Within this collection are key post-compromise indicators for you to uncover. By performing <b>stacking analysis</b> against these evidence sources, you'll be able to surface anomalies, trace attacker activity, and piece together a contextualized story of the compromise.</p>

<p>A set of investigative questions is provided to guide your work, but how you approach the dataset is up to you. You can use the pre-configured <code>.\Analysis\</code> scripts for a faster workflow, or increase the difficulty by relying solely on building your own queries. As a note: Kansa analysis scripts expect artifact data in the current directory, so feel free to copy/move scripts into the dataset folder you're currently working with for easier execution.</p>
